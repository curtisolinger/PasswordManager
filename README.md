This is a password manager. There are two files: main_sql.py and main_json.py. The main_sql.py program stores the data in Sqlite3. The main_json.py store the data is a json file. The main_json.py program is more advnaced as it contains the ability to search the data for website using regular expressions. I still need to modify main_sql.py to include regular expression searching for sql data.
